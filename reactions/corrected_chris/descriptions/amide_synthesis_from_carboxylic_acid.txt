A 50 ml vial was charged with a magnetic spin bar, amine (0.125 g, 0.38 mmol), carboxylic acid (0.109 g, 0.57 mmol), DMF (1.912 ml), and diisopropylethylamine (0.334 ml, 1.91 mmol). With stirring, catalyst (0.291 g, 0.76 mmol) was added and the reaction was warmed to 50 C for 3 h. The reaction was then diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extract was dried with MgSO4, filtered through a bed of Celite, and cone, in vacuo to yield the product which was purified via silica gel chromatography (80 g) using ethyl acetate/hexanes (1:1) as eluent to provide the title compound as an off white solid. (0.080 g, 45.3 %)
